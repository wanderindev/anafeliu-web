                        My name is  <strong>Ana Isabel Feliu</strong> and I am studying Industrial Design at Isthmus. What I love most about design are the stages of research and ideation. I often use the Design Thinking methodology and I enjoy leading work teams. I am interested in the design of home furnishings, ceramics and textiles. Nordic and Japanese aesthetics are a great inspiration, as <strong>I seek to use design to make the world less complicated</strong>. I stand out for my good attitude, positivity and sense of humor. This portfolio contains some of my work outside and inside my university.

                        Writer  <strong>Simon Sinek</strong> explains a concept of business organization called the golden circle. This consists of three concentric circles and each contains a question. Traditionally, companies have been defined based on what they do, then by how they do it and, finally, why they do it. However, a better strategy is to define first of all why, then how and, finally, what. <strong>Thus a more open way of thinking is cultivated</strong> and leaders motivate others to be guided by a common value or challenge, unlike a product or service with no apparent reason.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I like to use this method to organize my ideas because it clearly defines the most important features. This portfolio is no exception. I hope it serves to effectively communicate the why, how and what of each project. If you find the golden circle interesting, I recommend you adopt it and that it may serve you in some future endeavour.
