There is a safety bar in the back for people to easily climb in the vehicle. I placed a wide skylight for emergency exits in the middle. In case of an accident, two side handles are turned to unlock the skylight mechanism and pushed out with the center handles. In addition, there are two dust bags that expand with heat and serve as fire extinguishers, an extractor, and a safety bar for when the driver gets into the vehicle. Finally, there is a ribbon of light to illuminate the driver's area when required and when moving the wheelchair."
