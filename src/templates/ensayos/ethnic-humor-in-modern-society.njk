                    The use of ethnic humor in the media has emerged as a controversial topic of discussion in recent years. The tardiness of its dialogue is due to the fact that earlier societies did not allow for such a conversation to occur, since racial groups were encouraged to strive towards cultural homogeneity. Thankfully, “cultural values are not static,” as stated by Mahadev Apte, professor of Cultural Anthropology in Duke University. In his article “Ethnic Humor Versus Sense of Humor: An American Sociocultural Dilemma,” he argues that the evolution of social norms have resulted in the exaltation of distinct ethnical identities. This means that a race is no longer instructed to fully assimilate into a dominant culture, leaving behind any connection to their heritage. Nowadays, quite the contrary is true: society fosters pride in cultural diversity, and prompts races to accentuate what makes them different. A clear example of this can be seen in the movie Rush Hour, directed by Brett Ratner, where ethnicity is the main character and cultural differences are the tools through which it speaks. Exaggerating ethnic differences or broadcasting them under a humorous eye will make an audience appreciate the diversity that exists throughout cultures, and how ridiculous it is when those differences are looked down upon or suppressed. With this in mind, the film is an appropriate medium through which a conversation about the use and perception of ethnic humor in modern society can be considered, since it uses humor to successfully deliver a message intrinsically connected to race in a very public setting.

                    In order to discuss ethnic humor, however, one must first consider just humor alone, whose definition has evolved drastically throughout history. Ancient times dictated that one who engaged in jest was considered a fool merely wasting time; humor did not partake or engulfed, in any way, academic scholarship. This perception changed during the turn of the nineteenth century, when the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud defined the phenomenon as proceeding from “a saving expenditure in affect” (111). Freud explained that a perceiver of humor expects a character to invoke a negative emotion - such as anger, despair or horror - and, as a result, the empathetic perceiver prepares to experience the same feelings. However, in an unexpected turn of events, the character laughs or makes a joke. In such a case, the audience finds no need for the negative emotions and, as a result, the summoned psychic energy is expelled through laughter, originating in relief (112). Therefore, Freud and his contemporaries considered humor as nothing more than a natural expulsion of energy, a mechanical function. This theory is applicable multiple times throughout the movie. For example, in the beginning, Captain Diel of the LAPD reprimands Agent Carter because he “destroyed half a city block” in his last assignment, to which Carter replies: “That block was already messed up!” A spectator starts summoning anxiousness and regret expecting these emotions to be demonstrated on Carter’s end. However, Carter unabashedly makes a joke, completely unafraid. The spectator then realizes there is nothing to be worried about, and releases the pent-up energy through laughter.

                    A more modern approach presented by La Fave and recalled by Mahadev Apte is humor as “the ability to be readily amused not only in a large variety of stimulus situations, but also at one’s own expense” (qtd. in Apte). So, humor comes to be seen as hilarity not only brought about by external factors in the surrounding world, but also by noticing the ridiculousness in one’s own habits and mistakes through introspection. In Rush Hour, this self-analysis can be seen when Carter finds out that Agent Lee understands perfectly well the English language. Since Carter assumed in the first couple of hours of knowing Lee that he spoke exclusively Chinese, only for Lee to demonstrate his knowledge in a shocking turn of events, Carter states Lee is full of shit, to which Lee replies that Carter is the one who’s full of shit, which leads to the following conclusion: “Okay, fine, you're full of shit, I’m full of shit” and they both smile, finding humor in this situation at their own expense. Furthermore, Apte considers the ability to laugh at oneself as a desirable quality that leads to success in society, whereas humor had otherwise been traditionally casted under a negative light.

                    While these sources differ in multiple aspects due to humor’s flexible and intangible nature, there is an indisputable fact agreed upon in all centuries: not everyone has a sense of humor; not everyone has the ability to be amused by the external world and oneself, or, using Freud’s words, “it is not everyone who is capable of the humorous attitude: it is a rare and precious gift, and there are many people who have not even the capacity for deriving pleasure from humor when it is presented to them by others” (116). This phrasing, in turn, suggests an underlying admiration of humor from Freud’s part and not just the mechanical outlet of energy he so coldly describes in his book. With an eye on detail, one can start noticing the slight change in the public’s perception of humor. Perhaps, if Freud lived in today’s society, he would see it from a perspective more in accordance to Apte, and agree that it is, in fact, a desirable quality helpful in communal success.

                    It is paramount to note, however, that there is no better or worse among the arguments: they are all appropriate and correct in their corresponding epochs, taking into account the dynamism of cultural values. Nowadays, for instance, these might dictate the celebration of diversity. Therefore, ethnic groups across the globe, especially in the melting pot that is the United States of America, strive to highlight their singularities in contrast to other ethnicities. As a result, Apte argues that this has created a newfound cultural sensitivity, stemming from an increased awareness in perceived public image from ethnic groups, “especially the negative stereotyped that perpetrated and on which much ethnic humor is based.” As ethnic groups have established their presence in American society, they have also become the punchline of many jokes. In turn, this has resulted in multiple protests, law suits and public controversies.

                    Regardless, this does not necessarily correspond with a decline in the use of ethnic humor; on the contrary, it cannot be denied that comedians making fun of their own ethnicity is as commonplace and popular as ever. In his article, Apte argues that what has, indeed, changed is the setting in which this type of humor is employed. He explains that ethnic humor is now surrounded by situational constraints, moving it from the public to the private domain, where there is less room for misunderstanding. Freud might argue that this is due to the fact that not everyone has a sense of humor, much less one that allows for laughter in such a controversial situation. This might tragically result in evoking psychic energy for offence, and actually releasing it in anger instead of relief when confronted in such a way. Yet, ethnic humor is employed in public settings all the time. According to The-Numbers.com, the Rush Hour franchise produced 850 million dollars in revenue in the worldwide box-office using humor largely based on ethnicity. With Hollywood nowadays being a metonym for the entertainment industry, how more public than a Hollywood blockbuster can you get? Certainly, the movie wouldn’t have benefited from the same success if the topic of ethnicity had been discarded or ignored. Moreover, the use of ethnic humor contributes positively to the comedic aspects of the film, especially when it comes to Agent Carter’s ethnic identity.

                    It could be argued that certain jokes and punchlines could have been delivered by characters of ethnicities other than African American for Agent Carter’s role, yet the effect wouldn’t have been the same. For instance, early in the film Carter says that his mother tells people he is a drug dealer, because that is less embarrassing than admitting he works with the Los Angeles Police Department. This line could be funny delivered by a Hispanic, Italian, Caucasian, or an individual with any other cultural affiliation. However, the humor in this particular line operates on a deeper level by taking into account the history of tension between the LAPD and the African American community, which becomes possible by delivering it through a character of said ethnicity. From a Freudian point of view, one would expect to feel nervousness in seeing the relationship of the two historically antagonistic entities, but encounters only friendliness and tongue-in-cheek humor. However, this does not, in any way, undermine the importance of the several riots instantiated by police brutality based on racism in this city or the history that exists among both groups. Since the medium is strikingly public, Apte, too, might expect misunderstandings and conflicts to arise. However, Chris Tucker excels in amplifying his gestures and using slang in the most inopportune of circumstances. These stereotypical character attitudes can be seen when Carter talks on the phone with the little girl’s kidnapper. Yet, these refute Apte’s assumptions because the contrast between his easygoing attitude and the FBI’s otherwise frivolous atmosphere is exaggerated beyond ridicule, adding to the movie’s humor, instead of perpetuating racism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ethnic pluralism has, indeed, increased cultural sensitivity to humor, but constraining it to a private domain is not the way of diminishing stereotypes; ignoring the problem will not make it go away. Instead, presenting cultural differences through the critical lens of comedy will help the public appreciate diversity and realize the horrible mistake that is its suppression. In fact, employing ethnic humor in a public medium will address historical cultural tensions and bring relevance to racial issues, instead of propagating negative emotions, as has been shown with the success of Rush Hour. Just as the definition and, therefore, the perception of humor have evolved across history, these will keep on changing forever. All attempts for constraint are futile. If approached with a true sense of humor and an open mind, ethnic humor is more than enjoyable: it functions as a tool for celebrating cultural uniqueness and eliminating one’s own misconceptions and prejudices.
