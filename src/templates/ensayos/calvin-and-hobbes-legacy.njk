                    Humor is one of the most defining characteristics of the human race. From sunrise to sunset, jest and jokes are ingrained in everyday life to the point where our species would not be the same without it. The cartoon characters with whom we share a cup - or five cups - of coffee in the morning become dear old friends, and the characters of the sitcoms from late night television become as much a part of our family as the people with whom we watch them. Seeing as humor is such a significant part of our human experience, it would be borderline irresponsible not to study the strange phenomenon that is amusement along with its roots and consequences. A specific aspect of humor that will be explored in this paper is its lifespan: why does certain humor last longer than others? What must be taken into account if one were to achieve a long lasting legacy in the humorist department? Can humor last more than a couple of decades, or does it die with the birth of every new generation?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, comedy is largely news-based. Stand-up comedians and television shows focus mainly on current events. A great example of this is Saturday Night Live, a very successful television show that is known for basing all of its punchlines on whatever is relevant at the moment. In fact, its most popular skits involve actors imitating presidential candidates and exaggerating their characteristics to the point of absolute ridicule. Naturally, the material must change as regularly as the candidates. This makes the content funny only to the people who possess the necessary context of the skit’s unique political and cultural climate. A 90s kid watching a skit that aired during the 70s might not understand the humor because he or she never lived the particular events being parodied. Therefore, the spectator is not equipped with the necessary tools to enjoy the scene. Of course, this format does not take away any merit from the show. SNL’s long-standing success is undebatable. This is because humor is a conversation, and SNL keeps on adding value to the conversation week after week. Skits are hardly ever just about their pop references, but about the general, hidden themes that remain the same throughout history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a similar plane, we can find memes and video trends, such as The Harlem Shake and planking. These achieve instant wide-spread success and are often even used in relevance-obsessed platforms because of their news-worthy applicability. These crazes incessantly crawl into every corner of our lives until they suffer a tragic, although usually longed for, death. So, how can it be that something as widespread and popular as The Harlem Shake, which only started in 2013, can already be edging the abyss of insignificance? In just another decade, a joke concerning this or any similar craze, for that matter, can almost only be made as a reference to its own forgotten memory. Similarly, news-based shows and material from stand-up comedians reach peak popularity instantaneously, yet they deflate just as quickly. But, why? Well, in this paper, I will argue that the underlying cause of their decay is the same for the reason of its success: basing their content on news. Contrary to popular belief, a lack of specificity is what constructs lasting and effective humor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On this note, it is a known fact that the very definition of relevance is interim: whatever is relevant today in the news, will inevitably be irrelevant tomorrow. News are in themselves impermanent; if they weren’t impermanent, they would not be called news. Therefore, it can be argued that humor based on current events cannot remain relevant, since the events being ridiculed will inevitably become insignificant. A parody of the latest obsession in 2015 - be it a song, device, or event - will not be as funny in twenty years as it is today. Instead, if the goal is creating a lasting legacy, humor should revolve around general themes and refrain from making specific references that are exclusively pertinent in the moment of its conception. For instance, instead of creating a parody about the release of the iPhone 6s Plus which will remain relevant only until the next iPhone model is released, humor should orbit the topic of the extremes to which users will go to satisfy their consumer-driven lives. This would be a more effective method of achieving a lasting effect, without necessarily compromising the comedic aspect. In order to see how this could be achieved, we will explore Bill Watterson’s Calvin and Hobbes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Calvin and Hobbes is a daily comic strip that ran from 1985 to 1995 that deals with a very clever six-year-old boy named Calvin and his self-absorbed pet tiger, Hobbes. Through Calvin, Watterson raises his concerns about society and the direction in which we are moving, using humor as a tool to insert a serious message in a medium that does not even takes itself seriously. Its success can be seen in the fact that thousands of reprints and collections of the comic strips are sold every year, even though the last strip was published twenty years ago. At first glance twenty years might not seem like much, but compared with contemporary humorous content, Calvin and Hobbes is unbelievably ancient. This is due to Watterson’s use of abstract themes that are intrinsic to human nature, rather than their time-specific counterparts. Calvin and Hobbes’ revolutionary impact on the comic strip as a genre can be noted by anyone remotely familiar with the industry, better said by Lynn Michelle Swanbom’s thesis paper “Calvinistic Critique and Hobbesian Humor: The Rhetorical and Linguistic Benefits of Calvin and Hobbes in Popular Culture” where she states: “There are only two types of cartoonists anymore: those who are very heavily influenced by Bill Watterson and Calvin and Hobbes, and those who are trying to hide the fact that they’re very heavily influenced by Bill Watterson and Calvin and Hobbes.” (26) This  goes to show how this cartoon shook its medium and influenced so many artists later on. Calvin and Hobbes turned its genre upside-down, and did so by using a lack of specificity to create humor with a timeless quality to it. Contemporary comedians frequently chase after timelessness in their content, but mistakenly use the news and pop culture references as a basis for their jokes, when they should be using more general themes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order for any of the timelessness to occur, however, certain steps must be taken by the audience. Best put by Gregory Beda in his thesis paper “Comic Art as Medicine: Calvin and Hobbes and the Subjective Nature of Reality,” comic art is more than simply a product; it is also a process,
                </p>
                <blockquote class="pastel-yellow">
                    a participatory experience that implies movement, action, vitality, a flow of energy. Comic art is fluid, not stagnant. We do not simply view passive pictures and read static words on paper: we transform what we see into spirited images and vibrant prose in our imagination. When we hold Comic Art in general, and Calvin and Hobbes in particular, in the realm of imagination, we discover a vibrant world of latent potential, a future rich in possibility, rather than simply a mediocre "flatland" of entertaining words and pictures. (8)
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    This means that, in order to fully participate in the experience that can be provided by comics, the audience must engage with the visual content, analyze it, and consider what is being said beyond the drawings. Cartoons are probably the most underrated media, often being discarded as a fool’s entertainment, without considering the possibility that it can very well provide the most depth and internal realization, seeing as it demands a lot of interaction from the audience. Calvin and Hobbes, specifically, comments on a myriad of topics relevant to human existence - such as death, friendship and creativity - presenting the opportunity for the reader to create insights around a vast amount of topics. However, as these topics are so numerous and diverse, we will only be focusing on two.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first example is a topic which human beings have been discussing for centuries: the question of morality, and the debate of good versus evil. Calvin is a mischievous kid who, when Christmas-time rolls around, is very concerned about being perceived as good, so he can receive a great amount of presents for the holiday:
                </p>
                <figure class="essay-img-wrapper-center">

                    <p class="essay-caption">Figure 1. Santa’s Guidelines. Complete 3: 166.</p>
                </figure>
                <p class="dialogue">
                    CALVIN: I wish Santa would publish the guidelines he uses for determining a kid’s goodness. For example, how much does he weigh motives? Does he consider the kid’s natural predisposition? I mean, if some sickeningly wholesome nerd likes being good, it’s easy for him to meet the standards! I think just one good act by me, even if it’s just to get presents, should count as five good acts by some sweet-tempered kid motivated by the pureness of his heart, don’t you? Hey Susie! [Calvin knocks Susie over with a snowball.]
                    HOBBES: Of course, in your case, the question is academic.
                    CALVIN: I wanted to put a rock in the snowball, but I didn’t! That should be worth a lot! (Complete 3: 116)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, Calvin tries to justify his behavior by proposing a relative standard for goodness, and even this one fails. He hates behaving nicely and would much rather goof around. However, he refrains from doing so because he wants to receive gifts on Christmas morning. If he acts  like a good kid, a reward will come in time, raising the following question: if a person has ulterior motives for behavior, is the act truly good, or just evil in disguise? Is the person being selfless, or selfish by doing selfless acts for personal gain? In her thesis paper “Calvin and Hobbes: A Critique of Society’s Values,” Alisa Coleman proposes the following in regards to morality in Calvin and Hobbes:
                </p>
                <blockquote class="pastel-yellow">
                    The question is, essentially, what is important? Doing good or being good? Calvin thinks that doing good, even for the wrong reasons, is good, at least, is deserving of reward. Watterson is posing this question well, and it is a basic ethical question. There are those who believe that morality teaches us how to behave: If we do good, then we will want to do good. Some believe that the intention does not matter: Only the act is important. For instance, if the consequence of an act is producing good rather than evil, or a greater amount of good over evil, then the act is morally worthy. Some others claim that a moral action is only good if the intention is right. (23)
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                Coleman’s analysis goes on for multiple pages, giving us a glimpse of how a comic with just four panels can raise so many questions. Watterson wants the readers to see something of  themselves in Calvin, and allow them to critically examine their beliefs and actions. He doesn’t want to give us an answer of how to behave, but instead allow us to introspectively reach an authentic conclusion, one that is attuned with our moral system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another perspective on the same issue is provided by Thomas Hobbes’ superiority theory. In keeping with his generally negative view of humanity, Hobbes attributes humor to a competitive and merciless delight in others’ failures. Watterson’s brand of humor provides his audience with a sense of superiority because, when Calvin is humiliated for his adherence to certain principles, we are amused since we foresaw his absurdity even when he was unaware of it. In this example, we might laugh at Calvin because of his inability to behave properly in comparison to our ability to do so. Also, we might laugh because, unlike him, we are aware that his worry about being good is unnecessary, taking into account Santa Claus’ lack of existence and the fact that Calvin will get Christmas presents regardless of whether he throws fifty slush-balls at his neighbour, Susie Derkins, or none at all.
                </p>
                <blockquote class="pastel-yellow">
                    In Calvin’s case, Santa is the one who demands goodness, although it can be interpreted that Watterson is really making a reference to God, religion and sin. Is not committing a sin enough to earn salvation, regardless of the motivations, or does the genuine wish of being a good person needs to exist in order for it to count? In her paper, Swanbom dismisses the matter of the question entirely, since the outcome deals with something entirely different, according to her:
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    If Santa really is nothing more than Calvin’s parents, as every Christmas morning shows, he represents the relational meaning that gives humans without religion a reason to celebrate holidays like Christmas; the material nature of these interpersonal relationships also becomes a legitimate source of meaning in the absence of any substantive connection between being good and the supervision of a higher being. Every year, after building up Calvin’s suspense in the preceding weeks, Watterson dismisses Santa by Christmas and allows Calvin’s family to enjoy their time together. The scene shows no need for either God or Santa. (56)
                </p>
                <p>
                    These three analyses demonstrate the depth a single comic strip can have. It sparks a debate about morality by showing children’s tendencies to act especially good around Christmas so they can receive presents, while having an ancient human tradition as its only source of specificity. Even then, it dismisses the reference to Christmas by implying that the same can be said for different events and holidays, religious or otherwise. Santa, the demander of goodness, can easily be replaced with any type of god or even society, which expects a certain standard of decency from its members. However, this is not even the core of the matter. The ultimate message Watterson is trying to deliver concerns interpersonal relationships. In this case, he highlights Calvin’s relationship with his friends and, more importantly, with his parents, who will buy him Christmas presents regardless of his behavior. After all,
                </p>
                <blockquote class="pastel-yellow">
                    Calvin is rewarded, but not because he is good or bad. Rather, he is rewarded because his parents love him. Santa is the device he uses, and Santa is the one who initiates Calvin’s moral dilemma. However, in the end, it is not Santa, but his parents, who provide the presents and who accept Calvin no matter what. Perhaps it is not who Calvin is in his character that matters but what his relationship is to those around him. Perhaps Watterson’s is a relational ethic: Calvin receives gifts because he is the son of good parents; Calvin’s acts of goodness are directed usually toward Hobbes, his best friend. (Coleman 23)
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Calvin lives in a world shaped by those around him. So, rather than placing importance on the demands of an abstract, greater authority, perhaps we should just focus on our relationship with others. Watterson’s message could be that there may or may not be an entity that will reward or punish our behavior sometime in the future; the point is: we don’t know. Regardless, we do know the people that are here right now and we should be kind to them, not throw rock-filled snowballs at them. Of course, Watterson could mean something entirely different. The beauty of these cartoons lies in the fact that their generality opens up conversation and interpretation from all sorts of places in time, since it concerns a topic that is and will continue to be relevant for some time, deeming this strip lasting.
                </p>
                <figure class="essay-img-wrapper-center">

                </figure>
                <p>
                    Another one of Watterson’s most emphatic themes is the effect of human activity on nature and the Earth’s environment. In a particular strip, Calvin shows Hobbes he has captured a butterfly in a glass jar, to which Hobbes reply that if people could put rainbows in zoos, they would. This drives Calvin to release the butterfly:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Swanbom comments that “fully understood, there really is nothing humorous about this strip; the last line is merely a restatement of a purely capitalist attitude toward the environment, and in making people the victims, Watterson hits a nerve.” (60) Indeed, this strip is humorous in a sour way, since it is not trying to be funny, as much as it is trying to deliver an environmental message. Nature is supposed to be enjoyed organically, not in an artificial setting with corrupted motivations. Seizing parts of nature and stripping them of freedom so they can be used as a source of income removes their beauty and displays only our insensitivity. Nellie Mae Spicer, in her thesis paper “Theological Reflection with Calvin and Hobbes,” even connects it to theology and spirituality by writing the following:
                </p>
                <blockquote class="pastel-yellow">
                    Sometimes the simplicity of a cartoon strip can say as much as a whole volume on the meaning of geo-justice. The release of the butterfly acknowledges several things: beauty is to be cherished rather than possessed; all life forms are to be treated with respect and love; humans can have empathy for other lifeforms, including insects; God loves the world, not just humans; salvation, or health and wholeness, includes all of the world. (52)
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    This proposes a world where humans can appreciate nature while living in harmony with it, instead of trying to use it solely as a source of profit. The confinement of animals with the purpose of public display in the form of zoos has been an established tradition for multiple centuries. Instead, Watterson proposes a conservatism agenda, where it would be possible to admire nature as it should be - in its natural habitat - by letting it be. If, as Hobbes says, we could capture rainbows and did so, there would no longer be any rainbows in the sky.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the medium of comic art, Bill Watterson has achieved what countless humorists have attempted unsuccessfully: longevity. By basing his humor on general, abstract themes that will remain pertinent to humans for longer than the span it takes Apple to release a new iPhone, Watterson has enabled a timelessness to humor that would not be possible otherwise. These comic strips evoke critical thinking and analysis that will continue to entertain future generations, because their themes won’t be forgotten in a month or a year. Consumerism, conservation, education and other themes Calvin explore in the comics are not going away anytime soon; if anything, they are more and more prominent as time goes on, deeming this a stable, successful and lasting legacy. If anybody seeks to create humor that might last a couple of generations, they should follow Calvin and Hobbes’ example and step away from the use of news-based humor, favoring generality instead.
